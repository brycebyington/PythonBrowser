# browser.engineering Web Browser

Hello! I am currently reading [Web Browser Engineering](https://browser.engineering/) by Pavel Panchekha and Chris Harrelson. The book has a detailed guide on writing a rudimentary web browser in Python, which I will be following and uploading the source code to this repository.

My personal comments and notes will be included in the code, however most of it will be copied from the guide itself. I plan to also upload my personal notes at the end of my reading.

Thanks!
